Global idea: Associate a number with a mood so that a playlist can be formed according to the users mode.
This can be done by analyzing a song and make a profile containing BPM high/low frequencies etc. (also look at metadata)


In case of neural network:
input	: song profile
output	: mood associated with the song
Use a training set in which profiles are linked to moods.
Link the obtained neural network to spotify to associate a mood to all numbers people listen to. (goal is to pass all the songs through the neural network)

In case of fuzzy expert system:
input	: song profile
output	: mood associated with the song
Define a sets of rules on the song profile features, eg: 
if BPM is low then mood is happy u0.2
Obtain a mood using the set of rules
