The Man Who Sold The World lyrics
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare 
At all the millions here 
I must have died alone (Alt: I must have died along)
A long, long time ago

[x2]
Who knows? 
Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World
