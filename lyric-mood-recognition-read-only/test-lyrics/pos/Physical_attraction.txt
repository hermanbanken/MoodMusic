You say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere, this

Chorus:

Physical attraction [Physical attraction]
It's a chemical reaction
(1st time:) Mmmm
(2nd, 3rd, and 4th times:) Oooo
It's a physical attraction [Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh]
(1st and 4th times:) It's a chemical reaction, yeah
(2nd and 3rd times:) Sweet satisfaction, yeah

Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me

Crazy and when you smile
It's just makin' me want you more and more
Baby won't you stay a while
It could be such a fantasy, this

(chorus)

Intermediate:

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising, mmm
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

(Spoken:)
You're confusing me
'Cause I don't know if you want me
But I know that I want you
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
What are you gonna do?

Well, you say that you need my love
And you're wantin' my body, I don't mind
Baby all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine

You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere, this

Attraction [Physical attraction]
Reaction
It's so much satisfaction

Attraction [Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh]
Reaction
So much satisfaction

It's a physical, a physical
A physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction

A physical, physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction

A physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, chemical reaction
