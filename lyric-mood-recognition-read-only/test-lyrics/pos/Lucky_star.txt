You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me wherever you are
I just think of you and I start to glow
And I need your light, and baby you know

Chorus:

Starlight, star bright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, [star bright]
Make everything all right
Starlight, star bright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, [star bright]
Yeah

You must be my lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness seem so far
And when I'm lost you'll be my guide
I just turn around and you're by my side

(chorus)

Intermediate:

Come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right
Mmm, come on, shine your heavenly body tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna make everything all right

You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far
You may be my lucky star
But I'm the luckiest by far
